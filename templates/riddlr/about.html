                as: newly created or top rated riddles, and upvote or downvote each riddle
                solved. User specific riddles can also be found on that userâ€™s profile page and
                each user has an associated karma - the sum of the ratings of all their
                riddles. Additionally, users have a score calculated from the number of
                riddles they have solved. A difficulty will also be assigned to each riddle. This
                is calculated from how many guesses users take to solve the riddle (with
                an initial value supplied upon creation). Solving difficult riddles quickly will raise
                a users score faster.</div>
